# Javascript date objects:

#Example
const d = new Date():


# Creating date onjects.
* Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.

there are 4 ways to create a new date object:
* new Date()
* new Date(milliseconds)
* new Date(date string)
* new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)

# new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)

new Date(year,month...) creates a new date object with a specified date and time.
7 numbers specify year,month,day,hour,minute,second,and milliseconds(in that order.)

note** Javascript counts months from 0 to 11.
january=0
december = 11

specifying a month higher than 11, will not result in an error but add the overflow to the next year.

# new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(milliseconds) creates a new date object as zero time plus milliseconds.

Example :
const d = new Date(1565656565656);

Example :
const d = new Date(86400000);
one day (24 hours) is 86 400 000 milliseconds.

# new Date(date string) :
Javascript date input:
new Date(date string) creates a new date object with a date string.
 there are generally 3 types of Javascript date input formats.

 types                      Example

 ISO date                   "2015-03-25"(the international standard)
 Short Date                 "03/25/2015"
 Long Date                  "March 25, 2015" or "25 mar 2015"

 the iso format follows a atrict standard in js.
 the other formats are not so well defined.


 # Date Input- parsing dates
 Javascript has a built-in function called Date.parse() that parses a date string and returns
 the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

 Example :
 const d = Date.parse("March 25, 2015");
