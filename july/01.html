jquery

jquery is a lightweight, "write less ,do more",javascript library

the purpose of jquery is to make it much easier to use javascript on your website

jquery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of javascript code of accomplise,and 
wraps them into methods that taks you can with a single lines of code 

jquery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from javascript ,like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation .
 

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities




Why jQuery?
There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:
Google
Microsoft
IBM
Netflix




Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google




jQuery Syntax
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).
Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.

$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.

$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".






The Document Ready Event
You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:

$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});
This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.

    $("button").click(function(){
        $("h1").hide(300)
    })
})
