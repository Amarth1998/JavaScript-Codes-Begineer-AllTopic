# Javascript modules
 modules
 Javascript modules allow you to break your code into separate files.
 this makes it easier to maintain the code-base
 js modules rely on the import and export statements.

 There are two types of exports :
 *default exports
 *named exports

#named exports :-
with named export we can use export keyword with {}.
using named export we can export multiple items




# Import :--

There are two types of imports :
1. Named import
2. Default import

1. with named import we can use destructive{} method with items

like :
import{rollno, name} from "/.filename.js";

2. with default import we dont use {} destructive method we direct import the item with or without name because only one item will be export.

like:
import item from "/.filename.js";
